    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bring out the garlic bread — it's time for one of my favorite Italian
      dishes, spaghetti recipe with ground beef! While there's no such thing as
      bad pasta recipes, this one is particularly delicious thanks to the sauce
      + meat concoction you make all in one simmering, savory pot. And you can
      top it off with your favorite Italian cheese! I love giving my spaghetti
      recipe with ground beef a good grate of fresh parmesan. Yum!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Spaghetti Noodles</h3>
        <p>
          There are hundreds of types of noodles to try, and this dish is very
          variation-friendly. Or you could go gluten-free with zucchini noodles
          or my personal favorite, spaghetti squash!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Beef</h3>
        <p>
          This recipe calls for 80/20 ground beef. What this means is the meat
          will be 80% beef and 20% fat. Normally, I'd say you can swap it out
          for a lower fat percentage (90/10 for instance), but the high-fat
          content is important to make sure you have some leftover in the pan to
          sear your veggies and garlic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Marinara Meat Sauce</h3>
        <p>
          A good rule of thumb in cooking if you want to get the most fully
          rounded flavor of an ingredient is to add that ingredient prepared in
          three different ways. For this sauce, we're using crushed tomatoes,
          tomato sauce, and tomato paste, which will give you the fresh bite of
          tomato, the seasoned heartiness of tomato, and the thick, concentrated
          flavor of the tomato.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Italian Seasoning</h3>
        <p>
          Italian Seasoning is in the same class as chili spice — it's actually
          a combination of different herbs. A few shakes of Italian Seasoning,
          and you'll get basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary — sometimes even
          marjoram!
        </p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add beef to the pot, sprinkle
        with salt and pepper, crumble into small chunks with a wooden spoon and
        cook until lightly browned. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and set over
        medium-low heat (if you don't have enough fat in the pan, add a
        tablespoon of olive oil). Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and
        cook, until the onion is translucent, about 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return beef to pot then stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
        paste, Italian seasoning, and sugar. Bring sauce to a boil, then
        immediately reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 1 hour. Adjust
        seasoning as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile cook spaghetti in well-salted water, according to package
        instructions. Drain well and toss with sauce. Sprinkle with parsley and
        serve. Pass grated Parmesan.
