    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bring out the garlic bread â€” it's time for one of my favorite Italian dishes, 
        spaghetti recipe with ground beef! While there's no such thing as bad pasta recipes, 
        this one is particularly delicious thanks to the sauce + meat concoction you make 
        all in one simmering, savory pot. And you can top it off with your favorite 
        Italian cheese! I love giving my spaghetti recipe with ground beef a good grate of 
        fresh parmesan. Yum!
